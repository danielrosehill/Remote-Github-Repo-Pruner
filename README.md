## A Command-Line Utility for the Purging of Superfluous Github Repositories

Lo, this noble repository containeth a CLI utility most wondrous, wherewith the user may retrieve their GitHub repositories in interactive fashion, and hence choose whether to preserve or banish each one to the digital abyss.

### How to Employ This Enchanted Script

1. **Prepare Thy Token of GitHub**  
   Before thou mayst invoke the utility, thou must needs create a `.env` file in the root of the project.  
   Within, place thy GitHub token thusly:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=thy_most_secret_token
   ```

2. **Run It With Thy Will**  
   When this be done, thou mayst run the utility interactively, and peruse thy repositories one by one, deciding their fate: to keep, or to cast away.

### Purpose of This Artefact

This hath been forged for those souls who, in their zeal, have amassed a great hoard of repositoriesâ€”too many to count or manage. When the time for cleansing hath come, this tool shall aid in their purgation.

**Heed this warning well**:  
The tool shall delete thy repositories on the remote GitHub. Should thou hold any local copies, know that they shall not be altered by this act. Let it be upon thy conscience what is kept and what is lost.
